AlphaCare Insurance Solutions Data Analytics Project


Welcome to the AlphaCare Insurance Solutions Data Analytics Project! This project aims to analyze historical insurance claim data to optimize marketing strategies and identify low-risk targets for potential premium reductions, ultimately enhancing the company's competitiveness in the South African car insurance market.

Project Overview
The project focuses on several key areas:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and trends within the dataset.
A/B Hypothesis Testing to evaluate risk differences across provinces, zip codes, gender, and other factors.
Statistical Modeling to predict total claims and optimal premium values using machine learning techniques.

Reporting and recommendations based on the analysis findings to enhance insurance product features.
Tasks and Deliverables
Task 1: Project Setup and EDA

Create a GitHub repository for the project.
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the provided historical insurance data.
Summarize data statistics, assess data quality, and visualize key insights.
Task 2: Data Version Control (DVC)

Install and configure Data Version Control (DVC) for managing datasets and versioning.
Create versions of the dataset and push them to a local remote storage.
Task 3: A/B Hypothesis Testing

Conduct A/B Hypothesis Testing to analyze risk differences across provinces, zip codes, and gender.
Interpret statistical outcomes and report findings with business implications.

Task 4: Statistical Modeling

Prepare data for modeling by handling missing values, feature engineering, and encoding categorical data.

Build and evaluate machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict total claims and optimal premiums.

Compare model performances and analyze feature importance.
